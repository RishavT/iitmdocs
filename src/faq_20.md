Q88: Does clearing qualifier lock my program choice?
Answer: Clearing the qualifier for Data Science locks your oppurtunity to join the Data Science program. Similarly, clearing the qualifier for Electronic Systems locks your oppurtunity to join the Electronic Systems program. However, you will have to join the foundation level of the program within the term, mentioned in the admission letter. 

The qualifier marks will be valid for the 3 terms that come subsequent to the qualifier exam date for the learner to register to the Foundation level. This score will be invalid after this period and the learner will have to go through the entire qualifier process (the 1 month of weekly assignments) and retake the qualifier exam, if they wish to join the programme. For students in std XII who take the qualifier exam, the validity is for 3 terms from when they pass std XII.

Likewise, If the student attempt the qualifier exam for Electronic Systems and clears the qualifier exam, then it is not possible to shift from Electronic Systems to Data Science.
