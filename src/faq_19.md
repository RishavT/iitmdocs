Q85: Can I delay course registration after clearing qualifier?
Answer: Yes, but to a limited period. 
The qualifier marks will be valid for the 3 terms that come subsequent to the qualifier exam date for the learner to register to the Foundation level. This score will be invalid after this period and the learner will have to go through the entire qualifier process (the 1 month of weekly assignments) and retake the qualifier exam, if they wish to join the programme.

For students in std XII who take the qualifier exam, the validity is for 3 terms from when they pass std XII.

Q86: What happens if I clear qualifier but don’t register?
Answer: If you clear the qualifier but don't register for Foundation courses within the validity period (3 terms or ~1 year for Class 12 completers), your qualifier result expires and you must reapply and redo the entire qualifier process

Q87: Will I lose my seat if I delay registration?
Answer: No, you will not lose your qualifier status ("seat") if you delay registration—the result is valid for 3 terms (about 1 year), allowing you to register later without redoing the exam.

Q88: Can I clear qualifier and take a break before joining?
Answer: Yes, you can take a break after clearing the qualifier before starting Foundation courses—the result is valid for 3 terms (about 1 year) for those who have completed Class 12
