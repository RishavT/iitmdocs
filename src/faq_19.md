Q81: What should I do after clearing the qualifier?
Answer: After clearing the qualifier, check your dashboard for results (usually within 1-2 weeks), then complete course registration (select up to 4 Foundation courses based on your score, upload Class 12 docs if needed, choose exam cities, pay fees ~₹6,000/course)

Q82: How soon can I register for Foundation courses?
Answer: You can register for Foundation courses as soon as you receive your admission letter after successfully completing the qualifier exam. If you are a JEE-based entry candidate and your proof of eligibility is valid, you can register for the Foundation courses immediately after verification.

For regular entry candidates, registration for Foundation courses will be available after passing the qualifier exam.

Q83: Is course registration automatic after qualifier?
Answer: No, course registration is not automatic after clearing the qualifier—you must log in to the portal, access the registration form, select courses (up to 4 based on your score), upload proof of Class 12 completion, and pay the course fees.

Q84: Can I delay course registration after clearing qualifier?
Answer: Yes, but to a limited period. 
The qualifier marks will be valid for the 3 terms that come subsequent to the qualifier exam date for the learner to register to the Foundation level. This score will be invalid after this period and the learner will have to go through the entire qualifier process (the 1 month of weekly assignments) and retake the qualifier exam, if they wish to join the programme.

For students in std XII who take the qualifier exam, the validity is for 3 terms from when they pass std XII.

Q85: What happens if I clear qualifier but don’t register?
Answer: If you clear the qualifier but don't register for Foundation courses within the validity period (3 terms or ~1 year for Class 12 completers), your qualifier result expires and you must reapply and redo the entire qualifier process
