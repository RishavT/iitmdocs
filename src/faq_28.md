Q124: I want to come to IITM campus for exams
Answer: Please note that the IIT Madras BS Degree programme is a complete Non campus programme, and regular campus attendance is not required.

The Qualifier Exam and  end-term (semester) exams are conducted offline at designated exam centres (for students within India), not on the IIT Madras campus.

Students are required to appear for exams only at the allotted exam centres. Exams are not conducted on the IIT Madras campus.
