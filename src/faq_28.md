Q125: I failed the qualifier exam. How do I retry? When is the next attempt?
Answer: Within the same term, you get 2 attempts (end of week 4 and week 8). If you fail or are absent, you can reattempt without redoing assignments by paying the reattempt fee. In subsequent terms, you can attempt again with no limit, but must redo the full 4-week coursework and pay full application fees.
