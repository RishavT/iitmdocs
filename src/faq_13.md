Answer: If you fail the qualifier exam, you have the following options:

Reattempt in the Same Term: You can apply for a reattempt within the same term if you meet the eligibility criteria. This applies if you were absent for the exam or if you failed the first attempt.

Subsequent Terms: If you did not achieve the minimum assignment scores and did not become eligible for the qualifier exam, there are no limits on the number of times you can attempt the qualifier process in subsequent terms. You will need to pay the full fees applicable for your category and redo the 4 weeks of course work and weekly graded assignments to become eligible again.

Fresh Application: If you attempt the qualifier process again in a subsequent term, it will be considered a fresh application, and you must meet all requirements to qualify for the exam.
