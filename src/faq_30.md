Q133: I registered via JEE Mains but my portal shows "Qualifier" level. Why?
Answer: JEE scores are valid for only 3 terms from qualification date. If you qualified JEE in 2023 and applying in 2025/2026, your scores are no longer valid. You will be enrolled from Qualifier level. For JEE-based direct entry, scores must be from within the valid window (e.g., 2024 scores valid till Sep 2026).

Q134: Can I get a refund if I don't want the course anymore or can't write the exam?
Answer: No. The application fee for the Qualifier exam is non-refundable under any circumstances, including inability to write the exam, absence, or failure. The reattempt fee is also non-refundable. Please consider this before registering.

Q135: I uploaded my JEE scorecard but can't see it after submitting my application. Why?
Answer: After application submission, uploaded documents may not be visible in the preview. If your JEE proof is invalid or outside the valid eligibility window, you may be moved to non-JEE category and must complete the qualifier process. Contact support@study.iitm.ac.in if you believe there is an error.

Q136: I made a payment but cannot access the rest of the registration form. What should I do?
Answer: If payment is successful but you cannot complete registration, please contact support@study.iitm.ac.in with your payment receipt/transaction ID and registered email. Keep screenshots of payment confirmation for reference.
