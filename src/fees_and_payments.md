**Question**: After registering for a course in a term, can I carry over the fees to the next term if I am not able to complete the course?
**Answer**: No. A course registration is valid only for one term. If a learner is not able to clear a course in a term, they will be considered as having failed the course and will need to register for the course again at a later term along with the required fee.

Note that a learner will be allowed to drop off from a course within the first four weeks of the term. In such cases, a part of the course fee will be retained as admin charges and the balance, if any, may be carried over to the next term.

**Answer**: The overall program fees will not be paid at one stretch. The actual fees you will be paying in each term will be in proportion to the number of courses you register for in the respective term. So, if you register for 2 courses in a term, you have to pay the fees only for those 2 courses. For more details, please refer to the Fee Structure in the Academics Page.

**Question**: I belong to the general category and I want to avail fee waiver since my family income is below 5 lakhs per annum. Why do I need to submit EWS + Family Income Certificate to avail the waiver?
