# U Grade and Course Re-registration

## What is U Grade?
U grade means Unsatisfactory - you did not pass the subject/course.

## How to Clear U Grade
To clear a U grade:
1. Re-register for the course in a future term
2. Complete all requirements again (assignments, quizzes, exams)
3. Pay course fee again (~Rs 6000)

## Assignment Scores
Previous assignment scores are NOT carried forward for re-registration. You must redo everything.

## Prerequisites
If you have U grade in a prerequisite course, you CANNOT take the next level course.

Example:
- U grade in Math 1: Cannot register for Math 2
- Must clear Math 1 first
- Cannot take both simultaneously

## Improvement of Passed Courses
If you already PASSED a course, you cannot reattempt to improve marks. Once qualified/passed, cannot retake.

## Foundation Level Completion
Must clear ALL 8 Foundation courses to progress to Diploma level. No U grades allowed to move to next level.

## Re-registration Process
1. Wait for next term registration
2. Register for the failed course(s)
3. Pay course fee
4. Attend new term's coursework
5. Attempt quizzes and exams
6. Pass to clear U grade

## CGPA Impact
U grade affects your CGPA. Re-registering and passing will update your grade.

# FAQs

**Question**: What is the procedure to quit or exit the program?
**Answer**: The BS programme has multiple exit points. Depending on the courses completed and credits earned, learners can exit at any level with the corresponding certificate or degree.
For the complete flowchart showing exit paths, please refer to: https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/academics.html#AC1



**Question**: Can I take a break of 1 or 2 year(s) after completing the Foundational Level?
**Answer**: Yes, learners may take a break of one or more terms after starting the Foundational Level. However, learners must meet the intermediate milestone requirements, which is the maximum duration permitted for each level of the program.

Please note that break terms are included while calculating these intermediate milestones. Learners who do not complete a level within the specified maximum duration will be removed from the program.



**Question**: I'm eligible to apply 4 courses in the upcoming term, but I have only 2 Foundational Level courses left to complete. Will I be allowed to register for Diploma Level courses along with the Foundational Level courses?
**Answer**: No, you have to complete all the 8 courses in Foundation Level before enrolling to the Diploma Level courses.



**Question**: Is it possible to repeat a course for improving grades?
**Answer**: You can choose to repeat courses to improve the grade in the course within the same level and not progressed to next level.

For example: if a student completes the 8 courses of the foundation level and wishes to improve any course grade, they have to do it in the terms that are available within the maximum permissible terms. The student will not be allowed to take any foundation level improvement course once they start the Diploma Level.

The highest grade will be recorded in the transcript.
The highest score among all attempts of a course will be used for calculating the CGPA. Course fee for Repeat for Improvement courses will be double the normal fee.
