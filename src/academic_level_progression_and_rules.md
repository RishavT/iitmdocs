# U Grade and Course Re-registration

## What is U Grade?
U grade means Unsatisfactory - you did not pass the subject/course.

## How to Clear U Grade
To clear a U grade:
1. Re-register for the course in a future term
2. Complete all requirements again (assignments, quizzes, exams)
3. Pay course fee again (~Rs 6000)

## Assignment Scores
Previous assignment scores are NOT carried forward for re-registration. You must redo everything.

## Prerequisites
If you have U grade in a prerequisite course, you CANNOT take the next level course.

Example:
- U grade in Math 1: Cannot register for Math 2
- Must clear Math 1 first
- Cannot take both simultaneously

## Improvement of Passed Courses
If you already PASSED a course, you cannot reattempt to improve marks. Once qualified/passed, cannot retake.

## Foundation Level Completion
Must clear ALL 8 Foundation courses to progress to Diploma level. No U grades allowed to move to next level.

## Re-registration Process
1. Wait for next term registration
2. Register for the failed course(s)
3. Pay course fee
4. Attend new term's coursework
5. Attempt quizzes and exams
6. Pass to clear U grade

## CGPA Impact
U grade affects your CGPA. Re-registering and passing will update your grade.
