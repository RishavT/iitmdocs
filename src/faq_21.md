Q92: Is qualifier easier or harder than end-term exams?
Answer: Students and IITM faculty generally consider the qualifier to be moderately difficult but easier than the regular term (quiz + end‑term) exams, as long as you stay consistent with lectures and assignments

Q93: How much time should I prepare for the qualifier?
Answer: The qualifier spans just 4 weeks of coursework (about 10 hours/week expected engagement per course), so dedicate 4-7 hours daily consistently to lectures, assignments, and practice across the 4 subjects to clear it comfortably.

Q94: Is coaching required to clear the qualifier?
Answer: No, coaching is not required to clear the qualifier—IITM explicitly states you can self‑study the 4 weeks' content without going to any coaching center.
​Most students clear it through consistent self‑study of lectures, assignments, and PYQs, though optional coaching exists for extra support if needed.
