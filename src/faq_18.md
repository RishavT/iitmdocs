Q76: What proof is required for qualifier exemption?
Answer: For students seeking exemption from the qualifier exam through the JEE-Based Entry pathway, the following documents are required:

Valid proof of eligibility for JEE Advanced - admit card or JEE Mains score card. This proof is necessary to ensure that the candidate qualifies for direct admission to the Foundation Level without needing to complete the qualifier process. If the proof is valid, the candidate will be declared eligible to join the program directly.

Q77: Can exemption be rejected?
Answer: Yes, an exemption may be rejected if the required criteria is not met or the relevant documents are not submitted.

Q78: Can exempted students directly register for courses?
Answer: No, there are no "exempted students" for the qualifier or Foundation in the IITM BS online program, so no one registers directly for courses without it

Q79: Can international exams be used for exemption?
Answer: No, international exams like AP, SAT, A-Levels, or IB cannot be used for exemptions or credit transfers in the IITM BS program.
​Only NPTEL/SWAYAM courses (approved ones) qualify for credit transfer at later levels (e.g., BSc/BS), but the qualifier and Foundation require completing IITM's coursework without such exemptions.
