Q74: Do exempted students need to do qualifier assignments?
Answer: All the regular based applicants must mandatorily submit the assignments as the qulaifier eligibility depends on the assignment scores

Eligibility to appear for the qualifier exam
At the end of the 4 weeks, a qualifier exam will be conducted for eligible candidates based on
the content covered in the 4 weeks of study.
Each assignment will be graded out of 100
Any assignment that is not attempted will be marked as 0.
● If the average of the first 2 weeks’ assignment scores is >= 40/100 (or as per the cutoff
for each category of students) in each of the 4 subjects, the students will be eligible to
write the qualifier exam in the first attempt within the term.
● For those who do not qualify after the week 2 assignments, the average of the best 2 out
of the first 3 weeks’ assignment scores will be considered. If this score is >= 40/100 (or
as per the cutoff for each category of students) in each of the 4 subjects, the students
will become eligible to write the qualifier exam in the second attempt within the term.
● Reattempts within the term will be given suitably.

Q75: Can exemption be claimed after applying normally?
Answer: No. It is not possible for changing this option. Once the application has been submitted for regular entry, it cannot be changed for that particular term.
