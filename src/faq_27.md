Q121: What is the minimum score needed to pass a subject? I got 47 marks - have I passed or failed?
Answer: Passing criteria depends on your category:
General: 40% minimum in each subject, 50% overall average
OBC-NCL/EWS: 35% minimum per subject, 45% overall average
SC/ST/PwD: 30% minimum per subject, 40% overall average
If you scored 47 out of 100, you have passed for General category (above 40% threshold).

Q122: What are the passing criteria for SC/ST/PwD candidates in the qualifier exam?
Answer: SC/ST/PwD candidates need 30% minimum in each subject and 40% overall average across all 4 subjects to pass the qualifier exam. These relaxed criteria apply only to the qualifier process.

Q123: What does U grade mean? How do I clear a U grade subject?
Answer: U grade means Unsatisfactory - you did not pass the subject. To clear it, you must re-register for the course in a future term and complete all requirements (assignments, quizzes, exams) again. The course fee applies for re-registration.

Q124: What is the total score formula for calculating my final marks?
Answer: Total Score T = 0.1*GAA + max(0.6*F + 0.2*max(Quiz1,Quiz2), 0.4*F + 0.2*Quiz1 + 0.3*Quiz2)
Where GAA = Graded Assignment Average, F = Final Exam score. The formula picks whichever calculation gives you better marks.
