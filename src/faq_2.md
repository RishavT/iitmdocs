Q6: Can I join the program without taking the qualifier exam?
Answer: No, you cannot join the program without taking the Qualifier Exam if you are a regular entry applicant. The Qualifier Exam is a mandatory requirement for admission to the Foundation Level of the IIT Madras BS programme. Only candidates who qualify through this process can register for the Foundation courses.

However, if you have qualified for the JEE Advanced Exams, you may have a direct entry into the Foundation Level without needing to take the Qualifier Exam.

Q7: Is the qualifier a competitive exam or only qualifying?
Answer: The Qualifier Exam is primarily a qualifying exam, not a competitive one. Candidates must achieve the minimum required scores in each subject and an overall average to pass. The exam is designed to assess whether candidates meet the necessary criteria to join the Foundation Level of the IIT Madras BS programme

Q8: Does clearing the qualifier guarantee admission?
Answer: yes, it is guaranteed if you clear the qualifier until and unless without any documentation problem.

Q9: Is there a cutoff score for the qualifier exam?
Answer: Yes, there is a cutoff, and it is applied both per subject and on your overall average.
You must score at least around 40% per subject and 50% overall if you are in the general category (with slightly lower thresholds for OBC‑NCL/EWS and SC/ST/PwD categories), and only if you clear both the subject‑wise and overall cutoff are you considered to have passed the qualifier

Q10: Who conducts the qualifier exam?
Answer: The qualifier exam is conducted by the IIT Madras BS program administration. They are responsible for organizing the exam, including scheduling, providing the exam content, and managing the evaluation process.
