# Qualifier Score Validity

## Validity Period

The qualifier marks will be valid for the 3 terms that come subsequent to the qualifier exam date for the learner to register to the Foundation level.

## What Happens After Validity Expires?

- The score will be invalid after this period
- The learner will have to go through the entire qualifier process again (the 1 month of weekly assignments)
- They must retake the qualifier exam if they wish to join the programme

## Special Case: Class 12 Students

For students in Class XII who take the qualifier exam, the validity is for 3 terms from when they pass Class XII.

## Reattempting After Qualification

- Once a learner has successfully qualified, they will not be permitted to reattempt the Qualifier Examination during the validity period of their score
- The qualifier score will remain valid for the current term and the subsequent two terms
- After this period, the learner will be eligible to apply again

## Registration Options After Qualifying

### First Attempt Qualifiers
- Candidates who qualify in the first attempt within a term may register for courses in the same term
- Their qualifier score will be treated as the Quiz 1 score for calculating the final grade
- They may also register in the next two terms, as long as the qualifier score remains valid

### Second Attempt Qualifiers
- Candidates who qualify in the second attempt can register only from the subsequent term
- Registration is possible while the qualifier score remains valid
