How the Qualifier Works
The Qualifier Exam is not based on your prior school curriculum. Instead, it tests you on the first four weeks of coursework provided by the IITM BS program itself. These four weeks cover:

Mathematics for Data Science

Statistics for Data Science

Computational Thinking

English

As long as you thoroughly learn and understand the content provided during these four weeks of preparatory classes, you will have all the tools necessary to clear the Qualifier Exam, regardless of your previous mathematical background.
