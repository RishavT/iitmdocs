## Question 5: ✅ PASS

**Q:** Difference between Reattempt and Reapply Qualifier?

**Data Present:** YES

**Documents Found:** 15

Top documents:
  1. Academic Calender (47.5% relevance)
  2. Re Entry after Diploma (42.2% relevance)
  3. Changes in project grading (39.6% relevance)

**Bot Answer:**

The IIT Madras BS programme distinguishes between a "reattempt" and a "reapply" for the Qualifier Exam based on a student's previous status and the timing.

Here's the breakdown:

**Reattempt Qualifier:**
*   **Eligibility:** This option is for candidates who were eligible to appear for the first Qualifier Exam in a term but either missed it or failed it.
*   **Process:** They can appear for a second Qualifier Exam within the *same term* (typically after Week 8, following the first exam after Week 4).
*   **Coursework:** They **do not** need to repeat the 4-week coursework or assignments.
*   **Fees:** A reduced reattempt fee is applicable (e.g., Rs. 1500 for General/OBC, Rs. 750 for SC/ST/PwD).

**Reapply Qualifier:**
*   **Eligibility:** This applies to candidates who:
    *   Did not become eligible to appear for the Qualifier Exam in a previous term (e.g., did not meet the minimum assignment score criteria).
    *   Their previous Qualifier score has expired (valid for 3 terms following the exam date).
*   **Process:** They are treated as a "fresh application" in a future term.
*   **Coursework:** They **must** repeat the entire 4-week coursework and qualifying process from the beginning.
*   **Fees:** They must pay the *full qualifier exam fee* again (Rs. 3000 for General category, with applicable waivers).

In essence, a **reattempt** is a second chance within the same application cycle, while **reapplying** means starting the entire qualification process over again in a new cycle.

  3. Re Entry after Diploma (42.4% relevance)

**Bot Answer:**

The provided documents indicate that results for quizzes, programming exams (OPPEs), and end-term exams are published and released on specific dates. Your grades will be listed in your term-wise progress card and grade card, which are available in your student dashboard.

However, the documents **do not explicitly state** whether you will be able to review your individual answers after the exams or if the exam papers will be made available in your dashboard for review.

For clarification on the process of reviewing your answers after an exam, it would be best to contact the program support directly.

## Question 7: ✅ PASS

**Q:** Can exam city be changed or edited for quiz or end term exam?

**Data Present:** YES

**Documents Found:** 15

Top documents:
  1. Course registration - steps involved (47.4% relevance)
  2. Foundation level courses (46.8% relevance)
  3. Academic policies (45.7% relevance)

**Bot Answer:**

Yes, you can change or edit your exam city for quizzes and end-term exams.

Here's how it works:
*   **Selection during Registration:** When registering for courses in a term, students pick two cities for their quizzes and exams.
*   **Flexibility:** You have the freedom to choose a different set of cities than those opted for in previous terms. You can also choose different cities for each quiz and the final exam within the same term.
*   **Editing Window:** There are specific start and end dates within which you can edit your chosen exam city for each assessment.

For the **September 2025 term**, the last dates to edit the exam city are:
*   **Quiz 1:** Friday, September 19, 2025 - Friday, September 26, 2025
*   **Quiz 2:** Friday, September 19, 2025 - Sunday, October 26, 2025
*   **End Term:** Friday, September 19, 2025 - Sunday, December 21, 2025

## Question 8: ✅ PASS

**Q:** can i submit state issued document as income certificate or only central government issued is valid?

**Data Present:** YES

**Documents Found:** 15

Top documents:
  1. Timeline for original certificate (46.9% relevance)
  2. Eligibility Criteria Prize (40.3% relevance)
  3. Academic Documents for students (40.2% relevance)

**Bot Answer:**

The documents indicate that fee waivers are available based on category (General, OBC, SC/ST, PwD) and family income. For categories like General, OBC, SC/ST, and PwD, where income-based waivers are applicable, the documentation mentions "Income proof" along with the respective category certificates (e.g., EWS + Income proof, OBC-NCL + Income proof).

Specifically, for the OBC-NCL category, the program states: "Note that BC / OBC certificate is not the same as OBC-NCL (Other Backward Caste - Non Creamy Layer) certificate. Only applicants belonging to OBC caste as listed in Central Government’s www.ncbc.nic.in website and also belonging to Non Creamy Layer may apply in the “OBC-NCL” category. Other BC / OBC applicants must apply in the “General” category." This implies a requirement for certificates that adhere to Central Government guidelines for OBC-NCL status, which includes income criteria for the non-creamy layer.

While the documents do not explicitly state whether a generic "income certificate" (if submitted separately from the EWS/OBC-NCL certificate) must be central or state-issued, the emphasis on Central Government standards for OBC-NCL suggests that any income-related documentation should ideally align with central government formats where applicable for fee waivers.

For the most accurate guidance regarding your specific income certificate, it is recommended to contact the program's support team at `support@study.iitm.ac.in` or `7850999966`.
