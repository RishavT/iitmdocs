","According to the information provided in the document ""Courses in the programme.md,"" the credits are based on the UGC system where 1 credit corresponds to 14 hours of learner engagement and 1 credit in this system equals 3 credits in the IITM campus credit system.

Courses are generally described with total credits rather than individual course credit breakdown in the excerpts. There is no explicit list given of courses with exactly 3 credits in the documents shared.

However, from the structure:

Foundation level courses total to 32 credits for 8 courses, averaging 4 credits per course, so likely not 3-credit per course.
Diploma level courses are listed as 23 credits per 6 courses plus 4 credits for 2 project courses.
Level 3 and 4 courses have fees given per credit (Rs 2500/credit for level 3, Rs 5000/credit for level 4), but no specific course has 3 credits mentioned.
Therefore, the documents do not explicitly specify which individual courses are 3-credit courses. Most courses appear to be structured either as 4 or more credits or as part of a set of courses totaling credits.

"should I pay the full fee for all the four years at once or how will be the fee collected
","You are not required to pay the full fee for all four years at once. The program fee is collected level-wise or term-wise, based on the courses and credits you register for in each term.

Here's how the fee payment works:

Course-wise Payment: You pay only for the number of credits you register for each term. Fees vary depending on the level (Foundation, Diploma, BSc, or BS) and the number of credits you choose.

Level-wise Fee Structure:

Foundation level fee: Rs. 32,000 for 32 credits.
Diploma level fee: Rs. 1,25,000 for 46 theory + 8 project credits.
BSc level fee: Rs. 2.21 Lakh to 2.47 Lakh depending on credit combinations.

You pay fees online for the courses registered in that term.
Fee Waivers and Education Loan: Waivers based on category and income are available. SBI education loans are also facilitated if needed.
