Looking good. We made some more changes to the raw document. i have saved yet another version in pdfsrc/may2026-bs-qualifier_v2.zip. Can you
perform this task once again - but this time with the new raw documents in mind? To make things easer - since the changes are alreaqdy done,
do the comparision between pdfsrc/may2026-bs-qualifier.zip and pdfsrc/may2026-bs-qualifier_v2.zip now - and you may completely ignore the
first jan2026-bs-qualifier.zip file for this task. For a refresher you may read pdfsrc/compare.md once more - which is the detailed task
definition.
